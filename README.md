# Youtube Clone

This project demonstrates some of the functionality of Youtube.

As users type into the search bar, an API call is made to the Youtube API, which returns an array of videos for the user to view, play, and search again.

This sample project was built using React.js, Webpack, and Bootstrap. It is fully responsive.
